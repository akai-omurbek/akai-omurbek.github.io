title: "China's housing bubble and debt crisis"

## Description

China's debt crisis is closely tied to the property market bubble that is reigning in Chinese economy. One of the giants in the real estate sector - Evergrande - is struggling to pay interest rates. Other developers (probably 1/3 of them) are also facing same problems. 

One of the policy level methods to rein such a bubble is to introduce a property tax, which [Xi Jinping](xi_jin_ping.md) is trying to do - albeit as of now (November 2021) only in several pilot regions.

Real estate investment accounts for 15-30% of GDP, which is an enormous share. This is not a problem in and of itself if the buying process goes on in this country of 1.4 billion people. And it did for a long time - e.g. in 2008-10, the share of first-time buyers was 70%. This number, however, dropped to 11% in 2018 meaning large development investors have encroached into the market. All those newly built properties are not intended for rent (as the rate of profit is low), but exist solely with expectation of further expansion of the market (i.e. prices going up). 

One of the questions for the future is whether Xi and CCP will let Evergrande or others fail - or let them fall in a controlled manner [^1].
