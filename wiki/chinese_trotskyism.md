## Chinese Trotskyism

The early leaders of the Left Opposition in China were instrumental in the creation and running of CCP while being sufficiently versed in Marxism. However, the tradition became marginalized and pushed aside by the time of [Mao](mao_zedong.md).

In December 1952, the CCP conducted a purge of Trotskyists and Trotskyism thus decimating their power as a political force. Wang Fanxi thinks this is the result of Mao's theory of revolutionary war as a tactic, where everything can be subsumed under the needs and paradigms of war. Any expression of grassroots organization should be incorporated into the CCP state-building program. Thus revolution can be put in opposition to 'revolutionary war' in the sense, that every war despite its origins and aims is a centralized, non-democratic endeavour. This trait might be an endemic part of Maoism *per se*. Looking from today's perspective, Chinese *masses* cannot self-organize on a sufficient level to push through their own agenda and needs without those being subsumed under the rhetoric and goals of the CCP. Wang also raises an interesting point - socialist organizations are co-relational with the worker's movements, but if removed from them, they start 'absorbing elements of style, behavior, policies' of other classes'. In other words, the change in the character of leadership is inevitable in such situations [^1].
