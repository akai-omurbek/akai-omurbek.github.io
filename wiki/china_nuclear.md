## Description

Pentagon states that the number of nuclear warheads in China's possession is growing much faster than previously forecasted and my reach 1,000 by 2030. PLA might have already achieved what is called a "nuclear triad" - land, sea, and air missiles, that the two former superpowers had before. This aligns with China's President [Xi Jinping](xi_jin_ping.md) deadline of 2049 for his country to become a global military power [^1].
