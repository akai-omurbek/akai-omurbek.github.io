# Termux setup for my work 

_ _ _

## Description

This page will describe my ever-expanding setup for Termux on my Android device. I hope to be able to have many activities I do on my laptop manageable in Termux as well. 

### SSH

One of the first things I did was set-up an SSH connection between the Android and my laptop. As the Termux setup is still incomplete, I have to do that not to move at sluggish speed. The workflow is simple: I start an SSH daemon on Termux with `sshd`, and then connect from the laptop with an alias `sshterm` - then I'm good to go. 

### NeoVim

At the moment (24.11.21), I still use `Markor` to edit the text I want (on a folder synced with my laptop). However, if I want to start coding or writing my personal Wiki on Termux, I need to set-up a `Neovim` configuration suitable for phone usage.
