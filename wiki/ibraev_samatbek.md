## Biography

In November 2021, Samatbek Ibrayev proposed a draft bill "On the development of fintech". This document would make the National Bank responsible for the development of this sector of financial services. Earlier, Ibrayev had sought to introduce amendments to the law "On the National Bank..." which would define the notion of "fintech". The bill received negative reviews from the National Bank itself and was rejected.[^1]
