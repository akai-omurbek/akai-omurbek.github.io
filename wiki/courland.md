## History

In ancient times, the region was inhabitated by the tribe of Curonians. It was conquered and converted to Christinity by the Teutonic Order to be later a part of the Livonian Order until the XVI century. 

After the destruction of the Order, Courland as the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia was in a souzerain-vassal relationship with Recz Pospolita. Interestingly, the Duchy managed to build several outposts in Caribbean Islands and Africa. Its independence ended in 1795 with its secession into Russian Empire. 

In the aftermath of the Great War, the province would become an integral part of then independent Latvia after a series of back and forths between the USSR, German Empire and nationalist Latvian forces. From then on it would remain a territory of Latvia during its occupation by the USSR and after its independence.[^1]
