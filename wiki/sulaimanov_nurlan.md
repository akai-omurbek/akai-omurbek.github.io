## Biography

In 2012 Sulaimanov was charged with office mishandling. He allegedly gave tender lots to the affiliated companies. However, he was not held responsible - Nurlan flew to Germany and 'disappeared'. In 2016 Sulaimanov's case was closed due to expiration date. But in October 2020 he was already participating in parliamentary elections with [Kyrgyzstan party](PP_Kyrgyzstan.md) [^1].
