<p>Beishenaliev was a deputy principal of the Vistula University in Warsaw in 2012. Since 2013 lectured as a professor of John Hopkins University. Almazbek has completed an MA in Pedagogy in Ludwigsburg, Germany.</p>

<p>Beishenaliev was appointed the Minister of Education in October 2020 in <a href="zhaparov_sadyr.md">Zhaparov’s</a> cabinet. Beishenaliev’s initial goal was to create a new education system with less paper burden on teachers. Nonetheless, as the Minister, Almazbek introduced a new attestation form for teachers which contributed little to the aforementioned task.</p>

<p>As became known later, Beishenaliev applied for the position of UNESCO’s director-general, which he had no official stance to do, as the candidates are proposed by member-countries <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Almazbek left his position at the Ministry in May 2021.</p>
